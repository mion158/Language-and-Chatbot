        "of race feeling.  The principals and teachers told me that they had no\n",
        "difficulty whatever with the students.  If one of them did anything\n",
        "wrong, which was not often, he would be taken by the student policeman\n",
        "before the judge, who would try the case, and decide it on its merits,\n",
        "and punish or discharge his fellow student as justice demanded.  I was\n",

        "One of the main causes of the prosperity of the great American Republic\n",
        "is its natural resources.  It possesses coal, oil, silver, gold,\n",
        "copper, and all the other mineral ores.  Nature seems, indeed, to have\n",
        "provided almost everything that man needs.  The soil is rich; wheat and\n",
        "every kind of fruit can be grown; but favorable as are these native\n",
        "conditions they could not be turned to any great advantage without the\n",
        "skill and industry of enterprising men.  Many countries in Africa and\n",
        "Asia possess equal advantages, but they are not equally prosperous.\n",
        "This leads me to the consideration of another reason for America's\n",
        "growth.  The men who have migrated to the United States have not been\n",
        "rich people.  They went there to make a living.  They were prepared to\n",
        "work, their purpose was to improve their condition, and they were\n",
        "willing to undertake any manual or mental labor to accomplish their\n",
        "object.  They were hardy and strong and could bear a heavy strain.\n",
        "Their children inherited their good qualities, and so an American is\n",
        "generally more hard working and enterprising than most of the people in\n",
        "Europe and elsewhere.\n",

        "Another reason for America's success is the great freedom which each\n",

        "of his profession or trade.  Thousands of Americans who were once very\n",
        "poor, have become millionaires or multi-millionaires.  Many of them had\n",
        "no college education, they taught themselves, and some of them have\n",
        "become both literary and scholarly.  A college or university education\n",
        "does not necessarily make a man learned; it only gives him the\n",
        "opportunity to learn.  It is said that some college men have proven\n",
        "themselves to be quite ignorant, or rather that they do not know so\n",
        "much as those who have been self-taught.  I do not in any way wish to\n",
        "disparage a college education; no doubt men who have been trained in a\n",
        "university start in life with better prospects and with a greater\n",
        "chance of success, but those men who have not had such advantages have\n",
        "doubtless done much to make their country great and prosperous, and\n",
        "they ought to be recognized as great men.\n",

        "The general desire of the American people to travel abroad is one of\n",

        "Brainard, was equaled and exceeded; their cairn visited and their\n",
        "records removed. On April 21, 1902, a new American record of 84 17' was\n",
        "made by Commander Peary, further progress north being frustrated by a\n",
        "lack of provisions and by a lane of open water, more than a mile wide.\n",
        "This lead or lane of open water I have since become more familiarly\n",
        "acquainted with. We have called it many names, but it is popularly known\n",
        "as the \"Big Lead.\" Going north, meeting it can be depended upon. It is\n",
